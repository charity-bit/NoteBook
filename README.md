# NoteBook
An App Where You Can Create ,Edit and Delete Notes.  
Uses SQLite Database in a Read and Write Form.
I used a Grid Layout for collection view to display The notes in an somehow an uneven  rows.
![display notes page](https://github.com/charity-bit/NoteBook/blob/master/NoteBook/Screenshots/Screenshot_2020-08-17-22-45-41-40.png?raw=true)
![edit notes page](https://github.com/charity-bit/NoteBook/blob/master/NoteBook/Screenshots/Screenshot_2020-08-17-22-45-48-08.png?raw = true)

Once you click the back arrow in edit notes page ,the notes are automatically saved for you
It can also save a blank note with either the title being blank,or notes being blank ,or just both of them
