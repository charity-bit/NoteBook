# NoteBook

An App Where You Can Create ,Edit and Delete Notes.  
Uses SQLite Database in a Read and Write Form.

There is really , nothing special here,what I was trying to showcase was the UI ,that I really found was awsome.
I used a Grid Layout for collection view to display The notes in an somehow an uneven  rows.

![editNotesPage](https://github.com/charity-bit/NoteBook/blob/master/NoteBook/Screenshots/Screenshot_2020-08-17-22-45-48-08.png?raw=true)



Once you click the back arrow in edit notes page ,the notes are automatically saved for you.

It can also save a blank note with either the title being blank,or notes being blank ,or just both of them.
